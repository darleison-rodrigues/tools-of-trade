    "# 05 - Agentic Workflow (LLM + RAG + Tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the full agentic workflow, where your fine-tuned LLM interacts with the RAG system and external tools (shell commands, file operations) to accomplish complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "- Load the fine-tuned LLM and RAG system.\n",
    "- Define a user prompt that requires multiple steps, tool use, and knowledge retrieval.\n",
    "- Execute the agent loop, observing its thought process, tool calls, and retrieved knowledge.\n",
    "- Evaluate the agent's ability to perform tasks like code examination, writing, and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1.  **Ensure all previous steps are complete:** LLM fine-tuned, RAG database built.\n",
    "2.  **Review `scripts/agent_tools.py`:** Understand the available tools.\n",
    "3.  **Review `scripts/agent.py`:** Understand the agent loop logic.\n",
    "4.  **Run the agent:** Experiment with various prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code (Example of what you'd put here):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import sys\n",
    "# sys.path.append('scripts')\n",
    "# from agent import run_agent_loop, load_llm_for_agent, RAGSystem, CONFIG\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Load LLM and RAG system\n",
    "# print(\"Loading LLM and RAG system for agentic workflow...\")\n",
    "# llm_pipeline, llm_tokenizer = load_llm_for_agent()\n",
    "# rag_system_instance = RAGSystem(CONFIG)\n",
    "\n",
    "# # Example User Prompts:\n",
    "# # 1. Simple knowledge retrieval (should use RAG)\n",
    "# # user_prompt = \"Explain what Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is and its benefits.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 2. File system interaction (should use list_directory_contents)\n",
    "# # user_prompt = \"List all files and directories in the current project root.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 3. Code writing and execution (should use write_file, execute_shell_command)\n",
    "# user_prompt = \"Write a simple Python script called 'my_script.py' that prints 'Hello from my_script!' to the console. Then, execute this script and show me its output. Finally, delete the script.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 4. Code examination (should use read_file and RAG if related docs exist)\n",
    "# # user_prompt = \"Read the content of 'scripts/agent.py' and summarize its main functions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# # 5. Recursive debugging (more advanced, may need specific fine-tuning)\n",
    "# # user_prompt = \"Write a Python function that calculates the nth prime number and save it as 'prime_calculator.py'. Test it with n=5. If there are errors, fix them and re-test.\"\n",
    "\n",
